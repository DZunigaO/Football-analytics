# Football Analytics Portfolio

A collection of data science projects applying machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization to football analytics.

## About

I'm a Data Scientist with a background in economics, finance, and machine learning, passionate about applying rigorous analytical methods to football. I recently completed the **Data Science for Football Professionals** course at the University of Edinburgh.

**Technical Skills:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), R, statistical modeling, time series analysis, machine learning, data visualization

## Projects

### 1. Understanding Cagliari's Relegation: Progression Analysis
**Folder:** [`01-cagliari-progression-analysis/`](./01-cagliari-progression-analysis/)

**Description:** Investigation of why Cagliari Calcio was relegated from Serie A 2021/22, identifying critical weaknesses in ball progression through comprehensive event data analysis. The study reveals that Cagliari ranked last in the league for key progression metrics and relied excessively on low-success chipped passes rather than sustained positional play.

**Key Techniques:**
- Event data analysis and KPI benchmarking
- Correlation analysis between progression metrics and xG
- Spatial analysis and passing network visualization
- Player-level performance assessment

**Technologies:** Python, pandas, Matplotlib, event data processing

**Key Findings:** Cagliari's relegation was driven primarily by inability to progress the ball effectively (lowest bypassed opponents per pass in Serie A at 0.50), over-reliance on chipped passes, and lack of midfield involvement in progression phases.
